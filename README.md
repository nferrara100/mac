# Nick's Mac setup

Everything I need to painlessly configure my Mac exactly how I like it.

## Get started

⚠️ **Danger:** This will completely change your system. It is strongly
recommended to create a fork and comment out any parts you do not want before
using it yourself.

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickineering/setup/master/bootstrap.sh | /bin/bash
```

Once you run that script you will have to
[manually configure the remaining settings](MANUAL_STEPS.md).

## Changing your dotfiles

Changes to your dotfiles will be mirrored in your local copy of the repo in the
`linked` folder to make contributing upstream easier. Do not move the repo or it
will break the links!
