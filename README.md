# Nick's Mac setup

Everything I need to painlessly setup a new Mac.

## Get started on a fresh Mac

⚠️ **Danger**: This will completely change your system. It is only designed to be run on
a new Mac.

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nferrara100/mac/master/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

Once you run that script you will have to
[manually configure the remaining settings](MANUAL_STEPS.md).

## Changing your dotfiles

Changes to your dotfiles will be mirrored in your local copy of the repo in the `linked`
folder to make contributing upstream easier. Do not move the repo or it will break the
links!
